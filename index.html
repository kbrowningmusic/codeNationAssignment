                    <p>I'm Kat, a musician who stepped (sideways) from this world to dip her toe into the clear, cool lake that is the ever expanding world of tech.
                        <br>The lake is sublime - I can't see the bottom at the moment, nor the other side. I feel like I may never see it, but it’s still worth exploring…</br>
                    <p>I’m currently flitting between the sensations feeling thoroughly rinsed and tired to feeling completely energised by what I’m learning… and it is all underpinned with a kind of fierce determination to change my life.</p>

            <h3>1.1 - IT in  modern business</h3>
                    <strong>First thing's first: what is I.T.?</strong></p>
        
                    <p>I.T. stands for information technology, which can either be the study of or the use of systems to transport and store information.
                    The term information technology was first coined by Thomas L. Whisler and Harold J. Leavitt in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review.
                    <br>50 years ago, this term was rarely known, except by those who worked in large organizations, like banks and hospitals that needed to store data.</p>
                        
                    <b>Knowledge (data) is power...</b>
                        
                    <p>In modern business, IT operations and the world of development/coding are becoming closer and closer.
                        With the advent of the Data Protection Act [link to GDPR part of the site here!] and the more recent GDPR legislation, IT (Cyber Security) has also played an essential part in the reinforcing integrity of businesses through the protection of their databases. These databases house essential information about customers and their journeys/interactions  with businesses, which allows businesses to operate.     
                        GDPR essentially is the balance between the business need for information with the individual’s rights pertaining to their own data… more [here].

            <p>With the right planning, collection of skills and a clear overview of the goal in completing the said project ensures a robust framework to be able to cope with any unexpected hiccoughs.</p>
            
            <p>If planning of this a project manager doesn't plan for scenarios beyond human control (i.e. weather incidences, or a hacker), then the unexpected running costs (financial, time-frames, etc) could run higher and higher. This could render the remainder of the project more expensive, or even untenable or unsustainable.</p>

        <h3>1.3 - Planning and Implementation using my chosen technologies</h3>
            <p>I used the following technologies to plan my site:
                <ul>
                    <li>Trello (<a href=”https://trello.com/b/Mysl4xW3/code-nation-coursework-1-the-site:>click here</a> to follow a link to the Trello board in question)</li>
                    <li>Google Docs</li>
                    <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                </ul>
            <p>I made a Trello Board, accessible <a href=”https://trello.com/b/1nujV1sx/code-nation-coursework-outcome-1”>here</a>.
                <br>This helped keep the task in smaller chunks so as not to be too overwhelming.
            <p>The first list detailed the technologies I needed to download when at my laptop at home, followed by a list for the HTML aspect and the another for the CSS.
                <br>At this point I thought of perhaps using a piece of software called Adobe XD to help with the design of the site, however problems with the software download meant I had to abandon this early on. (there is a mock up <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1mtEr6piWPdY6aBAhw7ehZN8bvaTCFcibaS8rlTlgKZM/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>

    <div class="mintCreamBackground">
        <h3>1.4 - Describe the risks that migth impact digital projects </h3>
            <p>Imagine a contract between a client in the insurance industry (let’s call them Insuracare) and the provider (let’s call these Digiteck) to redesign the Insuracare’s customer database and servicing systems. The old system was over 30 years old, and using a command-prompt interface meant that the data storage and retrieval was clunky and straining to keep up with demand, all while being rather unfriendly for the user (customer service).
            <p>In short, system outages were common, leaving the business unable to function/make a profit, and GDPR risks were very real.</p>
            <p>Insuracare handed a huge brief with the specs of the system they required to IBM. IBM took the brief and fulfilled the job; unfortunately for them, Insuracare wasn’t too sure on certain aspects of the project, and so the latter asked for them to be changed… at great expense to both businesses. Digiteck finally decided that the project was untenable because they felt that Insuracare were being unrealistic in their expectations.</p>     
            <p>Had the proper Research and a planning/consultancy stage been done at the beginning of the project. Had the project been completed, the business would have gone from strength to strength. As it happened, the financial burden of having the project go wrong led to immediate stagnation in the insurance business as a whole; employee mobility was halted and even reversed (i.e. some managers were demoted back to customer service) and some people were made redundant.</p>
            <p>As for the system, Insuracare would have had to make do with a system from another business who were selling the rights to it - not an ideal for an insurer whose reputation was already damaged.</p>
            <p>In brief, digital projects require careful handling, and extensive planning.</p>
            <p>Click this <a href=”https://www.slideshare.net/dickyadams/common-digital-project-risks”>link</a> to find out more about some risks which are specific to Digital Projects - it is not exhaustive but has a bit more detail!</p>

    <div class="lightBlueBackground">
        <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting
            and using IT systems and software – how do you 
            select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
                <p>To begin working from home for a Customer Service Business, I will be required to select vital hard- and software.
                <p>The fact that I have to work from home means that it requires some very specific hard- and software in order for the customer servicing systems to work properly for me as the user and for the business. In turn all of these systems are secured with up to date antivirus and malware software.</p>
                <p>To top it all off, I am required to have a specific telephony set up regarding receiving calls.
                    (for the full list of what I require for this role, please click <a href:”http://itservice.sensee.co.uk/support/spec/IT-Specifications.html”>here</a>.)</p>
                    
                <p>For example, <a href:”http://sensee.co.uk/index.html”>Sensee</a>(my employer) specify that the machine upon which I would be working would have to be a PC and not a Mac. The reason for this is they do not have the support in place for Mac users - so should anything go wrong, they have made sure that they have the support line in place to get the problem solved efficiently (it is quite possible that it was too expensive as a business to pay support agents well versed in both MacOS and PC).</p>

    <div class="mintCreamBackground">
        <h3>1.6.1 Break the task before it breaks you…</h3>
        <p>Using Trello for creating this document has been extremely useful, even more so than I thought it would be… I’ve used Trello before but I didn’t really know how to use it to its fullest capabilities, because my projects simply weren’t large enough!<br> 
        I have been able to break the task down into manageable chunks (each numbered point has been given its own Google Doc page for me to write the content separately), starting with the topics I needed to cover as their own lists, with each list having a couple of cards to separate slightly different subtopics… I then had far too much fun creating checklists for All The Things.</p><br>
        Having done this I found out that some of the sections required entire boards to themselves so I might keep the information separate but accessible (e.g. why not have a drop-down menu for the 6 phases of a project? Or separate pages?). This also helped organise the information in my mind from a UX perspective.</p>
        <p>(NB: I attempted to download XD in order to design the look of my site, however I ran into some issues with that.
    Therefore, due to time constraints, I decided to investigate that for future projects…)</p>
    <p>Conclusion: I hadn’t appreciated how much this would calm the hum of anxiety with regards to the sheer number of tasks I needed to complete for the next two weeks - bitesize chunks are the way to go!</p>
    
    <h3>Git</h3>
    <p>Git is is an open-source distributed version control system which can be used to track changes in your source code. It can be used to track changes in any sort of files, and is often used by groups of programmers to coordinate work on collaborative projects.<br>
    
    Every computer has access to a Git directory; this directory does not need to rely on network access or central servers in order to function. Git has complete full history and full tracking capabilities.</p>

    </p>
    
    <h3>GitHub</h3>
    
    <p>GitHub is an online-based application, where you can commit your repositories (which you have prepared in Git - see above!) once you have done your coding - think of a slightly more complex ‘cloud’ like Google Drive where you upload your work.<br>
    Github offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.<br>
    You use Git to ‘commit’ (or upload) your files (which contain the code) up to GitHub so you might share/collaborate more easily; you can also use Git to ‘push’ changes made to your code up there too. (for more info on how to do this, just follow the link above).<br>
    The combination of how to use these technologies has meant that I am now set up for life in regards to cross-platform work, meaning I can (first of all!) ‘save’ the work I’ve done at the Code Nation site (and the neat little Macbook they’ve allowed me access to) so I might access it from my (rather older, clunkier but equally lovely) Macbook at home.<br>
    This has wider implications for me in that I can use both Git and GitHub to start to put together a portfolio in order for me to be able to start looking at coding jobs.</p>

        <h3>1.7 Describe and provide analysis on how your
            chosen technologies have helped you achieve
            your outcomes</h3>
            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (or GDPR, which <a href = “https://www.virtual-college.co.uk/news/virtual-college/2018/01/the-differences-between-gdpr-and-data-protection>replaced the 2010 Data Protection Act on the 25 May, 2018</a>) is a piece of legislation which has been put into place to protect individuals whose data has been collected and used by businesses.<br>
                The mutually agreed GDPR was designed to modernise laws that protect the personal information of individuals, as well as giving those individuals further rights over that information… and it included a subsection of legislation called the ‘right to be forgotten’ (although this sometimes is not applicable, for example when it comes to, say, the motor insurance industry where research into individuals and their activity as motorists).<br>
                If businesses are deemed to be non-compliant with the GDPR, the Information Commissioner’s Office (along with other, respective regulatory bodies, such as the FCA or Ofcom et al) can issue penalties such as fines - a few examples of businesses having breached these laws can be found <a href=”https://www.metacompliance.com/blog/5-examples-of-security-breaches-in-2018/”>here</a></p>

<!--MY REVIEW SECTION-->

<div class="reviewContainer">
        <h3 class="questionTitle">
          Describe the content and layout for each page</h3>
        <p>I started with a ‘through-composed’ format of the page, with the content laid out as per the assignment, just so I could get to writing the code for the website (this is what I was least confident on).<br> At the very least I tried the content comfortable
          to read and so chose some low contrast colours and kept fonts basic and clear to start with.<br> I wrote the content Google Docs so as to have access to it everywhere, ‘coding’ various tags instead of using the Docs formatting (this gave me a chance
          to practise a little as I wrote)</p>
        <p>I designed a site with a container with a background colour of Pale Goldenrod Yellow; I used div tags to then separate the following sections:
    
          <ul>
            <li>About Me (with photo)</li>
            <li>Contents Page</li>
            <li>Assignment Content</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="questionTitle">Evaluate the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h3>
          <h2>A Review of My Site</h2>
          <h3 class="questionTitle"> A Review of the ongoing use of IT tools in my project </h3>
          <p class="negative">I have found the project rather challenging and possibly a little overwhelming. <br>I feel that I possibly spent too much time on the content side of things; I had begun researching the topics and writing the content without first determining how
            it would look and my ideas for aesthetics and functionality.
            <br>I had not taken the time to simply think about what I wanted to do before the research. I believe this would have been a far better approach from a coding perspective, so I wouldn’t get so bogged down in future, perhaps using short sample texts
            to be able to ‘test’ the layout.</p>
          <p id="positive">As far as coding is concerned, however, I’m largely happy that I have made progress in becoming slightly more fluent and confident; I feel that this is in a large part due to my learning how to use Git and GitHub, as well as Visual Studio Code facilitating
            the numerous languages I’m learning.</p>
      
          <h3 class="questionTitle"> 2.2 - Trello </h3>
          <p>Whilst useful for planning the smaller aspects of a project,
            <id class="negative">I didn’t find it as intuitive when it came to prioritising the tasks I had to do.</id><br> I later discovered it was possible to sync it with iCal -
            <id class="negative">unfortunately it didn't seem possible with Google Calendars, which is a drawback.</id>
          </p>
          <p class="positive">After some practise with Trello, I have found that ordering tasks in my projects has become easier each time.</p>
      
          <h3 class="questionTitle">Visual Studio Code and Git/GitHub</h3>
          <p class="negative">
      
            <p class="positive">I found VS Code extremely helpful in its interface as well as its adaptability for those with scotopic sensitivities and eyesight.<br>I feel that learning about Git and GitHub was essential whilst using VS Code; I am becoming more confident in my
              use of them every time I commit code, though I still find it
              <id class="negative">clunky and time-consuming.</p>
      
            <h3 class="chosenTech">My Chosen Technologies: a conclusion...
              <p>I am a little slow at using them, but the important thing is I feel confident in my ability to plan and beginprojects more readily - and I look forward to building my portfolio using these tools.
              </p>
      
              <p>After this project is submitted and marked, I would like to use what I've done in a "Portfolio" page on my personal website <a href="katmuss.com">katmuss.com</a>
              </p>
          <h3 class=“ questionTitle”>What I <em>could</em> have done, but ran out of time...</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Profile Shot: a alt text/placeholder text (?) text, in case the image doesn’t load and for accessibility for blind users</li>
              <li>About Me Section: the image could have an opaque overlay appear (with the About Me text included) if the mouse hovers over it - this would keep the website concise</li>
              <li>Contents Section: links to the respective sections (using ‘anchor’ tags) within the contents section (to save time and endless scrolling) - this would save time on scrolling and be more accessible to those with disabilities</li>
              <li>Made the styling more consistent (this would have been helpful if I would have been pairing - a second pair of eyes is invaluable with coding and proofreading in general)
              <li>Explored more styling options within CSS for text
              <li>Explored the use of Javascript in my site</li>
          </p>
      </h3>
    
     <h3 class="questionTitle">
            Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
    
          <p>Copyright refers to the protections for the creative minds behind a creation; from writers to musicians, and the designers of websites, the rights to a piece of work automatically exists, without the need to register them first; having a formal
            registration process in place means that it may be easier to answer questions from disputes over ownership and creation, as well as sort out any financial implications.<br> Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because
            it may restrict what you are able to publish; intellectual property and it’s nuances may also delay a project’s completion, because asking for permission to use content can also take time.<br> If you have to use someone else’s content, it is good
            ask permission from the owners of any intellectual property. If this is not possible, it is essential to link to the original URL and to allow for content to be removed easily if you are asked to do so</p>
    
          <p>Here is a useful link to a PDF on intellectual property by Google <a href=”https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3463239?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiOufi7j-zgAhWpxoUKHcPzABkQlZ0DegQIARAB”> here </a>)</p>
    
          <h3 class="questionTitle">Accessibility for Websites</h3>
          <!--just discovered that I can simply begin the div class with "h3 class="" -->
          Those with disabilities can often find certain websites difficult to access. This could be due to sight, deafness or sensitivities when it comes to contrast (this is not an exhaustive list of issues to take into account). Some members of the disabled
          community may require non-standard software or web browsers so as to be able to navigate content and applications on the internet. Here is a set of <a href=”https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/versions/guidelines/wcag20-guidelines-20081211-a4.pdf”> Guidelines</a>      set out by W3C. Having images on a site is definitely worthwhile, but having an image descriptor allows blind users the chance to ‘see’ the images too. Equally, if a user has problems with hearing, it is important that any sound content is properly
          sign posted (though many video players and applications have the option of captioning as standard). It is important therefore to think of these users when designing the navigability of the site as the starting point. There is a useful site with
          a brief list of Assistive Technologies used by the blind community <a href=”http://www.id-book.com/preece/whatisitlike.html”>here</a>.</p>
