    <p>I'm Kat, a musician who stepped (sideways) from this world to dip her toe into the clear, cool lake that is the ever expanding world of tech.
        <br>I can't see the bottom of the lake at the moment, nor the other side. I feel like I may never see it, but it’s still worth exploring…</br>           
    <p>Here’s to learning to swim!</p>
