            <h1 class="aboutmetitle">About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Kat, and I originally hail from the land of music and customer service.
            I have 3 degrees in music, but I have stepped (sideways) from this world to dip my toe into the clear, cool lake that is the ever expanding world of tech.
            The lake is sublime - I can't see the bottom at the moment, nor the other side. I feel like I may never see it, but it’s still worth exploring…</p>
                
            <p>Suspending all this imagination for a moment, the reason I stepped this way is quite simple:
            I visited a loved one at Auto Trader one day a few years ago, and I saw how happy everyone was. 
            The floor was calm, and the work ethic clearly hadn’t suffered after the devs had been given full trust with their time (flexi-shifts? Core hours? What is this magic?), 
            resources (need a brain break? No problem - play pool or a PS4).</p>

            <p>Even their space had an element of freedom (they had drawn on the walls of the floor to help plan projects, or sprints).
            So here I am, enjoying (almost) the flitting between the sensations that are my brain feeling thoroughly rinsed and tired
            to feeling completely energised by what I’m learning, and its wider implications for my so far rather small world… all of this is underpinned with a kind of fierce desperation to change my life - I want to swim in that pool, make a splash and learn to swim all over again.
            So here’s to getting good enough to be an apprentice I guess...</p>

    <h3>1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in  modern business</h3>
        <p><div class="projectSubtitle"></div><b>1.1 What is IT?</b></p>

            <p>IT stands for information technology, which can either be the study of or the use of systems to transport and store information.
            The term information technology was first coined by Thomas L. Whisler and Harold J. Leavitt in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review.
            <p>50 years ago, this term was rarely known, except by those who worked in large organizations, like banks and hospitals that needed to store data.</p>
                
            <b>Knowledge (data) is power...</b>
                
            In modern business, IT operations and the world of development/coding are becoming closer and closer.
            With the advent of the Data Protection Act [link to GDPR part of the site here!] and the more recent GDPR legislation, IT (Cyber Security) has also played an essential part in the reinforcing integrity of businesses through the protection of their databases. These databases house essential information about customers and their journeys/interactions  with businesses, which allows businesses to operate.     
            GDPR essentially is the balance between the business need for information with the individual’s rights pertaining to their own data… more [here].

    <h3>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully"</h3>
        <h4>What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?"</h4>

    <h3>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website</h3>
            <h4>How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board</h4>
        <h4>People</h4>
        <p>Having the right team around you is imperative to the successful delivery of any project, no matter what the industry. I should know, I have run a concert series to a degree of success… but I can go no further without the support and drive from the right team.
            Ultimately, projects could be the businesses’ first steps into a new area for that business; projects are great when they succeed, but what if something goes wrong?
            With the right planning, collection of skills and a clear overview of the goal in completing the said project ensures a robust framework to be able to cope with any unexpected hiccoughs.
                For example, imagine a project to build a simple house within building regs; no bells or whistles, just a simple family home. The project has a great Manager (PM) who has in turn hired a fantastic team.
                Assuming all goes to plan, the job’s a good ‘un, and the family can move in!</p>
                
        <p>But what if there was a freak snowstorm for a week? What then?</p>
                
        <p>It seems that the planning of this project hadn’t factored this kind of event and planned contingencies for such scenarios,
            then the running costs (financial, time-frames, etc) could run higher and higher.
            This could render the remainder of the project more expensive, or even untenable or unsustainable.
            The project then becomes dead in the water, and may even have to be abandoned.</p>
                
        <p>This is just an example within one industry, but the model of working is applicable to many industries</p>
                
        <p>I have included useful links for a sort of template for the initiation process of a project; some tips on planning a project and choosing the right people… </p>
                
        As for Tea and Jam, I am in planning process to Relaunch the brand as a Cooperative Enterprise (I’m deciding if this would be the right fit at the moment!), so watch this space...
