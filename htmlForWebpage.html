            <h1 class="aboutmetitle">Hello World!</h1>
            
            <p>I'm Kat, and I originally hail from the land of music and customer service.
            I have 3 degrees in music, but I have stepped (sideways) from this world to dip my toe into the clear, cool lake that is the ever expanding world of tech.
            The lake is sublime - I can't see the bottom at the moment, nor the other side. I feel like I may never see it, but it’s still worth exploring…</p>
                
            <p>Suspending all this imagination for a moment, the reason I stepped this way is quite simple:
            I visited a loved one at <a href="https://careers.autotrader.co.uk/">Auto Trader</a> one day a few years ago, and I saw how happy everyone was. 
            The floor was calm, and the work ethic clearly hadn’t suffered after the devs had been given full trust with their time (flexi-shifts? Core hours? What is this magic?), 
            resources (need a brain break? No problem - play pool or a PS4).</p>

            <p>Even their space had an element of freedom (they had drawn on the walls of the floor to help plan projects, or sprints).
            So here I am, enjoying (almost) the flitting between the sensations that are my brain feeling thoroughly rinsed and tired
            to feeling completely energised by what I’m learning, and its wider implications for my so far rather small world… all of this is underpinned
            with a kind of fierce determination to change my life - I want to swim in that pool, make a splash and learn to swim all over again.
            So here’s to getting good enough to be an apprentice I guess...</p>

                    <div class="projectSubtitle"></div><b>First thing's first: what is I.T.?</b></p>
        
                    <p>I.T. stands for information technology, which can either be the study of or the use of systems to transport and store information.
                    The term information technology was first coined by Thomas L. Whisler and Harold J. Leavitt in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review.
                    <p>50 years ago, this term was rarely known, except by those who worked in large organizations, like banks and hospitals that needed to store data.</p>
                        
                    <b>Knowledge (data) is power...</b>
                        
                    <p>In modern business, IT operations and the world of development/coding are becoming closer and closer.
                        With the advent of the Data Protection Act [link to GDPR part of the site here!] and the more recent GDPR legislation, IT (Cyber Security) has also played an essential part in the reinforcing integrity of businesses through the protection of their databases. These databases house essential information about customers and their journeys/interactions  with businesses, which allows businesses to operate.     
                        GDPR essentially is the balance between the business need for information with the individual’s rights pertaining to their own data… more [here].

            <h4>What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?"</h4>
                <b>The Right People</b>
                    <p>Having the right team around you is imperative to the successful delivery of any project, no matter what the industry. 
                    I should know, I have run a <a href="teajam.live">concert series</a> to a degree of success…
                    but I can go no further without the support and drive from the right team.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, a project could be the businesses’ first steps into a new area for that business;
                    projects are great when they succeed, but what if something goes wrong?</p>
                    <p>With the right <a href="https://meritsolutions.com/6-phases-of-project-life-span/">planning</a>,
                    collection of skills and a clear overview of the goal in completing the said project ensures a robust framework
                    so as to be able to cope with any unexpected hiccoughs.</p>
                    <p>For example, imagine a project to build a simple house within building regs.
                    No bells or whistles, just a simple family home. The project has a great Manager (PM) who has in turn hired a fantastic team.</p>
        
                    <p>Assuming all goes to plan, the job’s a good ‘un, and the family can move in!</p>
                    <p><b> what if there was a freak snowstorm for a week? What then?</b></p>
                    <p>If the planning of this project hadn’t factored this kind of event and planned contingencies for such scenarios, then the running costs (financial, time-frames, etc) could run higher and higher. This could render the remainder of the project more expensive, or even untenable or unsustainable.</p>
                    <p>The project then becomes dead in the water, and may even have to be abandoned.</p>
                    <p>This is just an example within one industry, but it is applicable across the board.</p>
                    <p>I have included useful links for a sort of template for the initiation process of a project; some tips on <a href=”https://www.projectmanagement-training.net/category/six-phases/”> planning a project </a> and <a href=”https://www.brightwork.com/blog/6-tips-choosing-effective-project-team-members”> choosing the right people… </a>
                    <p>As for Tea and Jam, I am in planning process to Relaunch the brand as a Cooperative Enterprise (I’m deciding if this would be the right fit at the moment!), so watch this space…</p>

        <h3>1.4 - Describe the risks that migth impact digital projects </h3>
            <p>Imagine a contract between a client in the insurance industry (let’s call them Insuracare) and the provider (let’s call these Digiteck) to redesign the Insuracare’s customer database and servicing systems. The old system was over 30 years old, and using a command-prompt interface meant that the data storage and retrieval was clunky and straining to keep up with demand, all while being rather unfriendly for the user (customer service).

            <p>In short, system outages were common, leaving the business unable to function/make a profit, and GDPR risks were very real.</p>
                    
            <p>Insuracare handed a huge brief with the specs of the system they required to IBM. IBM took the brief and fulfilled the job; unfortunately for them, Insuracare wasn’t too sure on certain aspects of the project, and so the latter asked for them to be changed… at great expense to both businesses. Digiteck finally decided that the project was untenable because they felt that Insuracare were being unrealistic in their expectations.</p>
                    
            <p>Had the proper Research and a planning/consultancy stage been done at the beginning of the project. Had the project been completed, the business would have gone from strength to strength. As it happened, the financial burden of having the project go wrong led to immediate stagnation in the insurance business as a whole; employee mobility was halted and even reversed (i.e. some managers were demoted back to customer service) and some people were made redundant.</p>
                    
            <p>As for the system, Insuracare would have had to make do with a system from another business who were selling the rights to it - not an ideal for an insurer whose reputation was already damaged.</p>
                    
            <p>In brief, digital projects require careful handling, and extensive planning.</p>

                <p><b>1.6.1 Break the task before it breaks you...</b>
                        <p>Using Trello for creating this document has been extremely useful, even more so than I thought it would be… I’ve used Trello before but I didn’t really know how to use it to its fullest capabilities, because my projects simply weren’t large enough!</p>
                        
                        <p>I have been able to break the task down into manageable chunks (each numbered point has been given its own Google Doc page for me to write the content separately), starting with the topics I needed to cover as their own lists, with each list having a couple of cards to separate slightly different subtopics… I then had far too much fun creating checklists for All The Things.</p>
                        
                        <p>Having done this I found out that some of the sections required entire boards to themselves so I might keep the information separate but accessible 
                            (e.g. why not have a drop-down menu for the 6 phases of a project?
                            Or separate pages?). This also helped organise the information in my mind from a UX perspective.
                            <em>(NB: I attempted to download XD in order to design the look of my site, however I ran into some issues with that.
                        <p>, due to time constraints, I decided to investigate that for future projects…)</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Conclusion: I hadn’t appreciated how much this would calm the hum of anxiety with regards to the sheer number of tasks I needed to complete for the next two weeks - bitesize chunks are the way to go!</p></b>
